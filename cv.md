## About Me.

I do not always understand what is happening in the world, but I know exactly what is happening to me. It so happened that from childhood I liked to ask questions - "Why is this and not otherwise?" As a result, my questions led me to a long forgotten position. If you want to do well, do it yourself. As a result, my main activity was almost always related to sales. I couldn't invent or create these things, but I could sell them, especially the ones I liked.
I remember once they asked me: - "Why did you go to work for Coca-Cola?" At that time I would answer something like this: - "Well, this is the only big plant in the country with great potential and foreign capital."
Although in fact it was the most delicious drink from my childhood and I believed that I could share my sense of joy by delivering this drink to the most inaccessible places.
